# Slowpoker

This is a prototype of Slowpoker, a 2-player Pokémon-themed version of poker. This prototype is built to run in a terminal session, so as of now, the two players would have to share a computer.

## Running
To play run:
```
python3 run.py
```

## Rules
See [**RULES.md**](RULES.md).

<!-- ## Further work
This game currently can be played by two players, which would make for an interesting mini-game if ported to an actual Pokémon game. But my ultimate goal is to create a game that could be played in the Game Corner between only a dealer and the player. -->
