Hand Probabilities
==================

Hand rankings are determined by the probability of each hand being randomly selected. Less probable hands have higher rankings. 

There are `54 choose 5` = 3,162,510 ways to draw a hand from this deck.

## Joint Hand Probabilities
The row hands pertain to matches among types of Pokémon. The column hands pertain to matches among levels of Pokémon.

| Name	| Flush	| Quadruple	| Full house	| Triple	| Two pair 	| Total	|
| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	|
| **Full house**	| 0| 0| 0| 0| 918| **918**|
| **Flush**	| 0 | 0 | 0 | 7,344 | 14,688 | **22,032** |
| **Two pair** | 0 | 0 | 14,688 | 14,688 | 36,720 | **66,096** |
| **Pair** 	| 0 | 73,440 | 220,320 | 257,040 | 440,640 | **991,440** |
| **No pairs** | 25,704 | 257,040 | 514,080 | 514,080 | 771,120 | **2,082,024** |
| **Total** | **25,704** | **330,480** | **749,088** | **793,152** | **1,264,086** | ***3,162,510*** |


## Ranking Probabilities
From the table above we get the following hand rankings:

| Hand 	| Frequency 	| Percent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full house (types) | 918 | 0.029% |
| Flush (types) | 22,032 | 0.697% | 
| Flush (level) | 25,704 | 0.813% | 
| Two pair (types) | 66,096 | 2.090% |
| Quadruple (level) | 330,480 | 10.450% |
| Full house (level) | 734,400 | 23.222% |
| Triple (level)| 771,120 | 24.383% |
| Two pair (level) | 1,211,760 | 38.316% |

# Final Hand Probabilities

The rankings above would apply if each player was only drawing hands and comparing them head-to-head. However, in this game, the hands duel and knock out cards in the opponent's hand, which changes the final probability distribution.

I was not able to calculate the probability of each hand formulaically, so the following table is based on random simulations.

| Hand | Percent (simulated) |
| --- | --- |
| Full house (types) | 0.0056% |
| Flush (level)<sup>1</sup> | 0.0952% |
| Flush (types)<sup>1</sup> | 0.316% |
| Two pair (types) | 0.491% |
| Quadruple (level)<sup>2</sup> | 1.84% |
| Full house (level)<sup>2</sup> | 1.79% |
| Two pair (level) | 7.86% |
| Triple (level) | 13.7% |
| Pair (level) | 42.9% |
| Highest level sum | 31.1% |

<sup>1</sup> Notice that these two are flipped compared to the drawing probabilities above.

<sup>2</sup> This is a little catch in the probabilities. Whichever of these two is ranked higher will be more probable than the other. But they are not very distant in probability. That said, it may be worthwhile to always bet Quadruple when deciding between it and Full house (level).
